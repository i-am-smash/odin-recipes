  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 pound skinless and boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>2 medium lemons, juiced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of chopped, fresh parsley</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>Salt and Black Pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Dredge the chicken in flour. Dip it into the beaten egg. Lift in a way that the excess drips back into the bowl. Press into the flour to coat both sides. Repeat with the rest of the chicken.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and saute&#769 until almost cooked through or about four minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300&degF and grease a 9"x13" baking dish.</li>
    <li>Heat the chicken broth, wine, butter, lemon juice, parsley, salt, and pepper in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat while stirring occassionally until the butter melts. Stir water and cornstarch together in a bowl and, then, add to the broth mixture. Cook until it thickens slightly or about two to three minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken to the greased baking dish and pour the sauce over top</li>
    <li>Bake in the oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center or about ten to fifteen minutes. The chicken should be at least 165&degF when a thermometer is inserted into the  center.</li>
    <li>Plate and enjoy!</li>
